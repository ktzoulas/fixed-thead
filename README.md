jQuery fixed-thead Plugin
=============================================================================================================
A jQuery plugin which keeps the headlines of a large HTML table, fixed at the top of the screen.<br />

You have the ability to scroll through the contents of the table, but always be able to see the column headers as the top. Think of the "freeze panes" effect in Microsoft Excel.
